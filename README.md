# Real-Time-Face-Recognition
Real Time face Recognition using Python
- The code uses haarcascade_frontalface_alt. To learn about the same you can see to 
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

This is the trained library that uses opencv to recognize a face in the image

- Now, Steps to use the code:
- 1. Clone the repository to a folder

- 2. Create a folder naming "data" in the same folder

- 3. Run the face_data_collect.py
  -- 3.1. Enter the name of the user whose face has to be added
  -- 3.2 You will see the count of face ids being added to the data folder
  -- 3.3 Enter "q" to exit the window
  -- 3.4 You'll see the data of the user in the data folder
- 4. Run the face_recognition.py and you'll see the name of the users in the same image window.
